# SPEC

This repository expects `SPEC.md` to be the single source of truth for gameplay and milestone behavior.

## PR0 placeholder assumption
The user requested using "provided content" for SPEC and JSON config files, but no content payload was attached in this run.
For PR0, placeholder bootstrap content is created so repository structure and CI can be established.
Future PRs should replace these placeholders with the canonical spec and config values.
